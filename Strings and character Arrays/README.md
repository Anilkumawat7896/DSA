# String VS Character Array

character arrays are static in nature.

String are dynamically take size at the runtimelike vector in array.

## string

collection of characters

to take input in a string use this syntex

```c++
getLine(cin,name_of_string);
```

because string is a dynamiclly take size it does not require to give size

to take input of a line in character array use this

```c++
cin.getLine(character_array_name,size_of_array);
```

character array is a staticly sized array so it needs size for it
